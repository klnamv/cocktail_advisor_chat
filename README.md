# How It Works?


# OpenAI API Key 🔐
To interact with the GPT models, an API key from OpenAI is required. This key enables your application to authenticate requests to OpenAI's services, ensuring that usage is secure and measured.

Acquiring an API Key

Create an account at OpenAI.
Navigate to the API section and generate a new API key.
Once you have your key, you will use it in your environment file to authenticate API requests from your application.
Setting Up Your API Key

In the root of your project:

Create a `.env` file.
Add the following line: `OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'`.
This will allow your application to authenticate its requests to OpenAI.
